## Game Description

*Acquire Cylinder, Avoid Cone, Accrue Score*

In this minigame, the player maneuvers around a small map that gradually fills with cones and cylinders. Cylinders are still and touching them consumes them for 1 point, cones chase the player and on contact deal damage - at zero health the game is over. The player's goal is to collect as many cylinders as possible before they are inevitably swarmed by cones.

Controls:
Movement - WASD/Arrow Keys
Jump - Space (Double Jump is enabled)
Camera - Mouse
Pause - P
Swap View - F7


The hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal was the AI for the cones chasing the player. Even after lots of playing with blackboards and decision trees, when I was confident my AI setup was correct, the cone did not move. I thought the navigation mesh might be the issue, but this appeared correct as well. In the end, I had to reparent the cone to be a child of character, rather than pawn, for its movement commands to work - an obtuse solution I only tried after seeing an offhand comment in stackoverflow that doing so might be necessary.

The game is fundamentally very simple. The most interesting part of the gameplay itself is possibly the way the cones move, which is a result much better than I expected - they turn corners to hunt the player down when a wall is between them, and the way they form lines to jump over is quite satisfying. The most interesting part during game development was when I did the player's movement a second time. During the initial design the player's speed was much lower and there was no double jump. When I changed it and added significant new mobility, the game immediately felt much more playable. It was a lesson for me in that player mobility has a huge impact on the feel of a game and its enjoyment, which I will consider in future.

All requirements/tasks are complete:

The character is controlled by the player

The score changes on screen

Objects (cones and cylinders) are created and destroyed during play

NPCs (Cones) move to attack you

Sounds play on collisions

The level can be restarted from pause or death

The death menu is a final screen

The main menu has a settings submenu where you can set a resolution

A blueprint node created by me in C++ chooses a random float between 0.0 and an inputted max, this blueprint node is used to determine the time until the next spawn of a cone in each of the spawn zones
